- Design a company module where you have companies’ data with their employee’s data and projects.
- Create a RESTful API which you can apply CRUD on each module (on project module + auth).
- The API should allow only authenticated users to apply Create, Update, Delete.
- Don't forget about relationships, migrations and seeders.
- You can use Laravel/Symfony (Laravel).
- Dockerize the app to run at port 8080.
